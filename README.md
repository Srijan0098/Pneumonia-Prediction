## Pneumonia prediction from chest X-ray images using Deep Learning (PyTorch)
 
 The aim of this project is to build a deep learning model to predict pneumonia from chest X-ray images, which would aid radiologists to make accurate predictions and start treatment without further delay.
 I have trained an 8-layer deep convolutional neural network from scratch, as well as used Transfer Learning using ResNet50 backbone, and compared the model performances of both the networks. 
 Finally, I have implemented a vanilla version of visual saliency, which tries to find out where the neural network looks in an image, in order to arrive at its final decision.

The IPython notebook Pneumonia_Prediction.ipynb contains all necessary codes and it also imports the module custom_functions.py. 
Project_Presentation.pdf is the pdf of my project presentation, which explains some of the methods used.
